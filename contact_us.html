                    <h3>Resort Owner</h3>
                    <p>
                        Meet me, Elijah Rei Sabay, a young dreamer who have deicded to take the plunge into resort business
                        <br>in my beach-side, land in my hometown of Cebu, Philippines. <br><br>

                        With a busy career in software development and real-estate, every summer I would spend a few months <br>
                        travelling, staying in a variety of accommodations, ranging <br>
                        from hotels to luxury overwater villas. My favorite accommodations are small boutique propeties, getting to <br>
                        know not only fellow travelers, but often the owners. This <br>
                        personal, guest-focused experience was something I found <br>
                        lacking in my own local tourism, and knew one day, <br>
                        I wanted to be the ones to provide in Cebu <br> <br>

                        Combinig my passion in real estate, tourism and a sprinkle of programming, my <br>
                        dream has been to own an opearate a boutique beach <br>
                        resort. I am the ultimate beach bum, and acroll <br>
                        all my travels, the most beautiful place on <br>
                        Earth is still in my hometown of Cebu <br>
